traingame
=========



**traingame** is a 2D train racing game made for demonstrating AI applications. 
The game is based on Laurens Koppenol' [Train-a-Train](https://github.com/lkoppenol/train-a-train) Repository, 
With some additional tweaks to make it suitable for training Neural Networks. 
This code includes some examples using NEAT: Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies.

This project was initially used for a workshop at ProRail, the Dutch rail infrastructure company. This explains the train ;)


Warning
-------

This project is still Work in Progress. You could run into bugs when trying it out!


Documentation
-------------

Laurens documented his repository nicely. 
I didn't, but you can still use his documentation to gain a fair bit of knowledge about the traingame library.
